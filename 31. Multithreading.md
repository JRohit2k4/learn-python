## **Multithreading** :  
- Used to perform multiple tasks concurrently (Multitasking).
- Goood for I/O bound tasks like reading and fetching data from APIs
- syntax : `threading.Threads(target=my_function)`


```python

import threading
import time

def walking_dog(first_name):
    time.sleep(8)
    print(f"You done walking {first_name}.")

def cleaning_room():
    time.sleep(4)
    print("You done cleaning your room.")
    

def got_mail():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("You got mail.")
    

chore1= threading.Thread(target= walking_dog, args= ("Scooby",))
chore1.start()

chore2= threading.Thread(target= cleaning_room)
chore2.start()

chore3= threading.Thread(target= got_mail)
chore3.start()

chore1.join()
chore2.join()
chore3.join()

print("All chores completed")

```

## What this code does
- We created three different tasks ("chores"):  
**1.** `walking_dog()` → takes 8 seconds  
**2.** `cleaning_room()` → takes 4 seconds  
**3.** `got_mail()` → takes 2 seconds  
- If you ran these without threading, total time would be :  
   8 + 4 + 2 = 14 seconds
- But with multithreading, they run concurrently, so total time is only about 8 seconds (the longest task).
- Shows how multiple tasks can overlap in time.
- Demonstrates Thread creation and .join() (to wait for all threads).
- Mimics real-world chores happening at the same time.
