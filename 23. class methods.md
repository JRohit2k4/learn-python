## Class methods
- Allow operations related to class itself.  
- Take (cls) as the first parameter, which represents the class itself.
- Best for class-level data or require access to the class itself

```python
class Student:

  count = 0

  def __init__(self, name, gpa):
    self.name = name
    self.gpa = gpa
    Student.count += 1

  #Instance method
  def get_info(self):
    return f"{self.name} = {self.gpa} GPA"

  @classmethod
  def get_count(cls):
    return f"Total # of students: {cls.count}"
  

student1 = Student("Bob", 6.9)

print(Student.get_info(student1))
print(Student.get_count())
```
