## @property :  
- Decorator used to define a method as a property (it can be accessed like an attribute).  
- Benefit: Add additional logic when read, write or delete attributes.  
- Gives you getter (to read), setter (to write), and deleter (to delete) method.

## getter method:  
- A getter is just a method that lets you get a value safely.
- With @property, you can make it look like a normal variable while still controlling access.

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, marks):
        self._name = name        # private attribute (by convention, starts with _)
        self._marks = marks

    # Getter for name
    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name        # ✅ safely return name

    # Getter for marks
    @property
    def marks(self):
        return f"{self._marks}/100"   # ✅ adds formatting

s = Student("Rohit", 85)

print(s.name)    # calls getter → Rohit
print(s.marks)   # calls getter → 85/100
```
```
Output:  
Rohit
85/100
```


## setter method:  
- With a normal attribute → Python is like: “Sure, whatever you assign, I don’t care.”
- With a property + setter → Python is like: “Hold on, I’ll check your value first. If it passes my rules, then I’ll allow it.”

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self , age):
        #self.name = nmae
        self._age = age

    @property
    def age(self):
        return self._age
    
    @age.setter
    def age(self, value):
        if value < 0:
            print("Age can not be less than 0.")
        else:
            self._age = value

p = Person( 20)


p.age = -10
p.age = -200
print(f"Age is {p.age}")
```
```
Output:
Age can not be less than 0.
Age cannot be less than 0.
Age is 20
```

## deleter method:  
- Use to delete an attribute.
- just know that it exists.
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self , age):
        #self.name = nmae
        self._age = age

    @property
    def age(self):
        return self._age
    
    @age.setter
    def age(self, value):
        if value < 0:
            print("Age cannot be less than 0.")
        else:
            self._age = value

    @age.deleter
    def age(self):
        del self._age
        print("Age has been deleted")

p = Person( 20)
print(f"Age is {p.age}")

del p.age
```
```
Output: 
Age is 20
Age has been deleted
```
