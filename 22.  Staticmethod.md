## **Static methods**  
A method that belong to a class rather than any object from that class (instance).  
usually used for general utility functions.

**Instance methods** = Best for operations on instances of the class (objects)  
**Static methods** = Best for utility fuctions that do not need acces to class data

```python
class Employee:
  def __init__(self, name, position):
    self.name = name
    self.position = position

  def get_info(self):
    return f"{self.name} = {self.position}"
  
  @staticmethod
  def is_valid_position(position):
    valid_position = ["Manager","Cook","Janitor"]
    return position in valid_position
  
employee1 = Employee("Eugene","Manager")
employee2 = Employee("Squidward","Cashier")
employee3 = Employee("Spongebob","Cook")
employee4 = Employee("Sandy","Rocket Scientist")

#print(Employee.is_valid_position(employee4.position))
print(employee1.get_info())
print(employee2.get_info())
print(employee3.get_info())
print(employee4.get_info())
print(f"{employee4.name}'s job position = {Employee.is_valid_position(employee4.position)}")

```
