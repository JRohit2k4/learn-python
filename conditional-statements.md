# Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions based on conditions. In Python, we use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition evaluates to `True` or `False`. Python provides several conditional statements.

## Types of Conditional Statements

| Statement   | Syntax | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **if** | `if condition:` | Executes a block of code if the condition is `True`. |
| **if-else** | `if condition: else:` | Executes one block if `True`, another if `False`. |
| **if-elif-else** | `if condition: elif condition: else:` | Checks multiple conditions in sequence. |
| **Nested if** | `if condition: if condition:` | An `if` statement inside another `if`. |
| **Shorthand if** | `statement if condition else statement` | One-line `if-else` for compact code. |


## 1. `if` Statement  
Executes a block of code if the condition is `True`.

### Example:
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")  # Output: x is greater than 5
```

## 2. `if-else` Statement  
Provides an alternative block to execute when the condition is `False`.

### Example:
```python
x = 3
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")  # Output: x is 5 or less
```

## 3. `if-elif-else` Statement  
Allows multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.

### Example:
```python
x = 10
if x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
elif x == 10:
    print("x is exactly 10")  # Output: x is exactly 10
else:
    print("x is greater than 10")
```

## 4. Nested `if` Statements  
An `if` statement inside another `if` statement.

### Example:
```python
x = 20
if x > 10:
    if x < 30:
        print("x is between 10 and 30")  # Output: x is between 10 and 30
```

## 5. Short-Hand `if` (Ternary Operator)  
Used for quick conditional assignments.

### Example:
```python
x = 10
#formula = 'X' if condition else 'Y'
result = "Greater" if x > 5 else "Smaller"
print(result)  # Output: Greater
```
