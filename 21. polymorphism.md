## Polymmorphism: 
- Greek word that means to "Have many forms or faces"
- Poly = Many
- Morph = Form

**TWO WAYS TO ACHIEVE POLYMORPHISM:** 
1. Inheritance = An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class
2. "Duck typing" = Object must have necessary attributes/methods


**Polymorphism using Inheritance :**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Shape(ABC):
    
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
      pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
      self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
      return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2
  

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, side):
      self.side = side

    def area(self):
      return self.side ** 2
  

class Triangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, base, height):
      self.base = base
      self.height = height

    def area(self):
      return self.base * self.height * 0.5 

#polymorphism in action
shape = [Circle(5), Square(4), Triangle(3,4)]

for shape in shape:
    print(f"{shape.area()} cmÂ²")

```
